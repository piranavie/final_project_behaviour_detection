Text_formate

 Each row of 'Temporal_Anomaly_Annotation.txt' is the annotation for a video, for example:
Abuse028_x264.mp4  Abuse  165  240  -1 -1
-	The first column is the name of the video
-	The second column is the name of the anomalous event
-	The third column is the starting frame of the event (you will have to convert each video to image frames first)
-	The fourth column is the ending frame of the event.
-	For videos in which second  instance of event occurs, fifth and sixth contains starting and ending frames of second instance.  Negative number (-1) means no anomalous event instance. In this example, only one instance of “abuse” is in this video.
Another example:
Arson011_x264.mp4  Arson  150  420  680  1267
-	In this example, there are two instances of anomalous event “arson”. The first instance starts at frame# 150 and ends at frame#420. The second instance is from frame 680 (start) to frame 1267 (end).

Normal_Videos_003_x264.mp4  Normal  -1  -1  -1  -1
-	Normal videos do not contain any anomalous event, therefore have (-1) everywhere.
Note: Ours videos have 30 frames per second.
